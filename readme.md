# ScholarshipFund Smart Contract

## Project Title
**ScholarshipFund - A Decentralized Scholarship Platform**

## Project Description
ScholarshipFund is a decentralized Ethereum-based platform where individuals can donate funds and students can apply for scholarships. The smart contract allows students to register and apply for scholarships, while donors can contribute funds to the scholarship pool. The contract owner has the authority to grant scholarships to students based on their requests and available funds.

## Contract Address

## Project Vision
The vision behind the ScholarshipFund project is to create a transparent and decentralized scholarship platform where anyone can donate to support education and students can receive financial help based on merit or need. The platform aims to reduce bureaucracy in scholarship allocation and give more power to the community (donors) in selecting scholarship tration**: Students can register on the platform by providing their name and university.
- **Donations**: Anyone can donate funds to the scholarship pool, which will be used to fund student scholarships.
- **Scholarship Granting**: The owner of the contract (admin) can grant scholarships to students based on the available funds.
- **Transparency**: The balance of the scholarship fund is publicly viewable, allowing transparency in how funds are collected and distributed.
- **Event Logging**: Events are emitted for student registration, donations, and scholarship grants, providing traceability for all actions.

## Smart Contract Functions
1. **registerStudent(string memory _name, string memory _university)**: Allows a student to register with their name and university.
2. **donate()**: Enables anyone to donate Ether to the scholarship fund.
3. **grantScholarship(address _student, uint256 _amount)**: Allows the contract owner to grant a scholarship to a registered student, transferring the scholarship amount.
4. **getBalance()**: Returns the current balance of the contract, showing how much Ether is available in the scholarship fund.

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites:
- **Solidity**: Version `^0.8.0`
- **Ethereum Wallet** (such as MetaMask) to interact with the smart contract.
- **Truffle** or **Hardhat** framework for testing and deploying the contract.
- **Ganache** or a test network like **Rinkeby** for testing deployments.

### Steps to Deploy:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install Truffle or Hardhat:
     ```bash
     npm install -g truffle   # For Truffle
     npm install --save-dev hardhat  # For Hardhat
     ```

2. **Compile the Contract**:
   - Using Truffle:
     ```bash
     truffle compile
     ```
   - Using Hardhat:
     ```bash
     npx hardhat compile
     ```

3. **Deploy to a Testnet**:
   - Configure your test network (Rinkeby, Goerli, etc.) in `truffle-config.js` or `hardhat.config.js`.
   - Deploy the contract:
     - Using Truffle:
       ```bash
       truffle migrate --network rinkeby
       ```
     - Using Hardhat:
       ```bash
       npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
       ```

4. **Interact with the Contract**:
   - Use tools like **Ethers.js** or **Web3.js** to interact with the deployed contract and perform actions like registering students, donating, and granting scholarships.

        emit StudentRegistered(msg.sender, _name, _university);
    }

    // Function to donate to the scholarship fund
    function donate() public payable {
        require(msg.value > 0, "Donation amount must be greater than zero.");
        donations[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        emit DonationReceived(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }

    // Function to grant a scholarship to a student
    function grantScholarship(address _student, uint256 _amount) public onlyOwner {
        require(students[_student].isRegistered, "Student not registered.");
        require(address(this).balance >= _amount, "Insufficient funds in the contract.");
        students[_student].totalReceived += _amount;
        payable(_student).transfer(_amount);
        emit ScholarshipGranted(_student, _amount);
    }

    // Function to get contract balance
    function getBalance() public view returns (uint256) {
        return address(this).balance;
    }
}
```
